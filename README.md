# Movie Recommender 🍿👀🎞

The goal of this project is to create a movie recommender whith different types of recommendations - item-based recommendations, user-based recommendations, popularity-based recommendations etc. 

## How did I realize this? 💡

I wanted the recomennder to be interactive and give the user different types of recommendations based on their preferences. Therefore I started to work on a little interactive 'chatbot', that asks for name and favorite movies.
Based on this information the following types of movie recommendations are computed:
- A selection of generally well likes movies. 
- Movies, whose genres match with the users favorite movie.
- Films that were liked by other users with similar preferences.
- Movies, that have matching characteristics with the users favorite movie.

All of this was then wrapped into a streamlit app, so the user will be presented a nice user interface. Additionally I got the movie posters from an API, so the appearance resembles a lot to Netflix.
